<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in Mexico living in Japan, polyglot, teacher, and an aspiring programmer.</p>

<p>Being able to speak over 6 languages woke my curiosity to learn another type of language. This time, I wanted to start learning programming languages. I am currently learning Python and HTML.</p>

<p>Started Python in February 2024, and HTML in July of the same year, I am highly motivated to achieve proficiency in these and more languages. </p>

<p>In Python, I am already able to create simple text-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, or a 1 player BlackJack game.  </p>
